## 🚀 What Is Astronav+?

**Astronav+ ⛑️** is an open-source, human-first spacecraft navigation and survival assistant system designed to help space travelers not only reach their destinations — but stay alive doing it.

Unlike traditional orbital calculators, Astronav+ prioritizes life-support logistics, maintenance checks, and emergency decision-making alongside orbital mechanics. It asks the hard questions when humans forget to — like:  

> _"Are you sure your oxygen filter’s still good for this mission?"_  
> _"Do we have enough food for the long-route gravity assist?"_  
> _"Can we reach Phobos in time to resupply before systems fail?"_

## 🌌 Why It Matters

As spaceflight becomes more common, and eventually civilian, **navigation alone isn’t enough**. We need intelligent systems that help people:

- Make better life-critical decisions under stress
- Manage supplies and maintenance mid-flight
- Adapt dynamically to failure and redirection
- Navigate both space and survival — together

## 🔧 What It Does (Planned Core Features)

| Module                  | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Survival Intelligence Module (SIM)** | Tracks crew stress, oxygen, food, filter status, maintenance needs, life support stats. Offers suggestions and warnings. |
| 🛰️ **Navigation Planner** | Offers 3 routing modes: Fastest, Gravity-Assisted, and Balanced — with burn timing, delta-v, and supply forecasts. |
| 📦 **Supply Forecasting Engine** | Calculates time-to-depletion for food, oxygen, water, based on crew, ship config, and route. |
| 🛠️ **Engineering Checklists** | Interactive maintenance prompts. Tracks wear rates, consumable usage, damage risks. |
| 🚨 **Emergency Protocols** | Reroutes missions based on failures or supply shortages. Connects to known depots, rescue bases, or automated drones. |
| 🗣️ **AI Copilot Dialogues** | Friendly assistant that explains options, questions assumptions, and reduces alert fatigue. |
| 🌐 **Open Collaboration** | Designed to grow — any contributor can add logic modules, UI improvements, survival models, or translations. |

## 🌠 Vision

Astronav+ is not a product. It’s **a long-term commitment to safety, clarity, and foresight**. It will never prioritize speed over life, and never forget that the human in the chair matters more than the chart on the screen.

From filter swaps to interplanetary hops...  
**Astronav+ ⛑️ is your partner in the void.**
